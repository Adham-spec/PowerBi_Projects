# Product & Tax Analysis Dashboard

## üöÄ Project Overview
A comprehensive, dual-view Power BI dashboard designed to provide a holistic analysis of business performance. This report allows stakeholders to seamlessly switch between analyzing core product metrics (Sales, Profit, Orders) and examining key tax-related figures, enabling data-driven strategic decisions.

## üìä Key Features & Analysis
This dashboard is composed of two main interactive pages:

### 1. Product Analysis Page
* **High-Level KPIs:** Tracks essential metrics including Total Orders, Total Profit, and Total Sales, with a clear Year-over-Year (YoY) growth percentage for each.
* **Dynamic Metric Slicer ("Target"):** A key interactive feature allowing users to select a metric (Total Quantity, Total Profit, Total Orders, or Sales). This selection dynamically changes the main Donut Chart to show the quarterly breakdown of the chosen metric.
* **Time-Based Filtering:** Users can easily filter the entire report by Month, Quarter, and Year to drill down into specific periods.

### 2. Tax Analysis Page
* **Tax-Specific KPIs:** Monitors critical tax metrics such as Average Tax, Sales Including Tax, and Total Quantity, complete with YoY performance indicators.
* **Monthly Sales Trends:** A line chart visualizes sales performance on a monthly basis, making it easy to spot trends and seasonality.
* **Hierarchical Tax Breakdown:** An interactive drill-down visual that allows for a detailed analysis of total tax amounts by Year, Quarter, and Month, providing granular insights into tax liabilities over time.
* **Seamless Navigation:** Clear buttons allow for easy switching between the "Product Analysis" and "Tax Analysis" views.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
* **Power BI Desktop:** Used for data modeling, visualization, and creating an interactive user experience.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Implemented for advanced calculations including:
    * Time intelligence functions to calculate Year-over-Year (YoY) growth.
    * Dynamic measures using `SWITCH` and `SELECTEDVALUE` to power the "Target" slicer.
* **Power Query (M Language):** Utilized for data cleaning, transformation, and preparation.
* **Data Source:** (e.g., Financial Database, E-commerce Platform Data - replace with your actual data source).

## üí° Learnings & Insights
* **Insight:** The dashboard effectively demonstrates the relationship between high sales periods and their corresponding tax implications, providing a more complete business picture.
* **Challenge Addressed:** The main technical challenge was creating the dynamic "Target" slicer. This was solved by writing a flexible DAX measure using the `SWITCH` function, which changes the calculation based on the user's selection, making the report highly interactive and user-friendly.






# HR Attrition Analysis Dashboard

## üöÄ Project Overview
This interactive Power BI dashboard is designed to analyze and identify the key drivers behind employee attrition within an organization. It aims to empower HR departments with actionable insights to understand patterns, mitigate risks, and improve employee retention strategies.

## üìä Key Features & Analysis
* **Overall Attrition Performance:** Displays key metrics such as total employees, attrition rate, average monthly income of leavers, and average years since last promotion.
* **Demographic Attrition Breakdown:** Analyzes attrition based on marital status, age groups, and education fields.
* **Job Role Impact:** Identifies specific job roles and departments experiencing higher attrition rates.
* **Interactive Filters:** Allows users to dynamically slice and dice data by distance segment, experience level, gender, marital status, and income segment for deeper insights.
* **Overtime Impact:** Highlights the number of employees who work overtime among those who left.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
* **Power BI Desktop:** For data modeling, report design, and visualization.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Utilized for complex calculations and custom measures (e.g., Attrition Rate, Monthly Income for Attrited Employees).
* **Power Query (M Language):** Employed for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes to clean and prepare raw data.
* **Data Source:** (e.g., Employee HR Data CSV, SQL Database - replace with your actual data source).

## üí° Learnings & Insights

* **Insight 1:** Understanding how specific job roles contribute disproportionately to overall attrition.
* **Insight 2:** Identifying correlation between factors like overtime and attrition rates.
* **Challenge Addressed:** (e.g., "Ensuring data integrity from multiple HR data extracts and transforming it into a cohesive model for analysis was a key challenge overcome using Power Query.")
